# Event Synopsis

* Extreme heat wave in California during August 15-20 2020 [1] [2]
   * Temperatures up to 20 degF above normal across WECC
   * 80 million people within affected regions, 32 million in California
   * Unusual lack of cooler evening/night temperatures
   * Shelter-in-place/work-from-home increased forecasted residential AC demand
   * Heat resulted in derating of conventional generation
   * High clouds, haze, and smoke resulted in derating of solar
   * Hydro generation derated due to below normal water conditions
   * Imports from NW limited due to increased demand in NW and intertie derating
* August 14-15 2020 rotating blackouts ordered by CAISO
* Supply shortfalls projected for Aug 17-19 required statewide load relief
* Root causes identified by CAISO
   * Climate change induced extreme heat wave resulted in exceeding existing electricity resource adequacy. 
   * Transition to reliable, clean, and affordable resource exceeded planning targets for evening hours, resulted in demand/supply mismatch
   * Day-ahead market practices exacerbate supply challenges during stress conditions

# Resource performance 

* Natural gas
   * Powerplant derates are already considered in planning models
   * Fleet asked to make effort to improve plant efficiency [3] [4]
* Imports
   * Imports were 40-50% higher than RA obligations
   * Excessive reliance on uncontracted/unobligated imports
* Hydro/pumped hydro:
   * Hydro/pumped hydro resources provided more than obligated by RA
   * Need for better coordination with storage plant operators ahead of stress conditions [5]
* Solar/wind
   * Reliability of intermittent resource is over-estimated during net peak hours
   * Need to better account for time-dependent capabilities of intermittent resources
* Demand response
   * RDRR did not provided required RA load relief when called
   * Lack of response partially attributed to "gross-up" credits from avoided transmission and distribution losses [6]
   * WECC does not understand where the rest of the discrepancy comes from [7]
* Energy storage
   * Only 200MW of RA batteries in CAISO market
   * Not enough to assess performance
* Market operation
   * No evidence of market manipulation
* RA capacity
   * CAISO identified resources that must offer/run, including exceptions for use-limited, run-of-river, and conditional-availability units. Wind and solar must offer/run includes variability. See Table 3 for details.
* CAISO
   * Bid submitted on behalf of must-offer units that don't meet their obligations
   * Incentive payments available to flexible resources that meet performance metrics
   * Exceptional/manual dispatches are used to address reliability issues

**Table 3: August 2020 RA obligations**

| RA Component | RA Capacity |
| --- | ---: |
| CEC load forecast | 44,740 MW |
| 15% contingency reserve margin | 6,674 MW |
| **Total RA obligation** | **51,413 MW** |
| Actual RA shown to CAISO | 48,916 MW |
| RMR (must-run) contracted resources | 290 MW |
| Credits from local regulatory authorities | 2,197 MW |
| **Total RA, RMR, and credits achieved** | **51,413 MW** |

# Model Salient Features

* WECC 240 bus network model (NREL)
* Weather from NSRDB
   * Hourly weather (wind and solar may need to be subhourly)
   * Localized weather for each WECC node
* Load model
   * Residential load from ResStock
   * Commercial loads from ComStock
   * Industrial loads from AGM/ALM [8]
   * Agricultural loads from AGM/ALM
   * Public services loads from AGM/ALM
   * Transportation loads from AGM/ALM
* Generation fleet
   * Powerplant data from Global Energy Monitor 
* Generation dispatch
   * Only gas, coal, oil, bioenergy, geothermal in OPF.
   * Natural gas prices from Henry Hub (need to consider separating Texas/Alberta prices)
   * Other production costs from TBD
   * Nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar dispatched based on availability
   * Outages from CAISO report [9]
* Operations
   * Load shed dispatch from CAISO report
   * Powerline outage control from CAISO report
* Simulation
   * Powerflow solvers runs hourly
   * OPF runs hourly
   * Loads and generation updated between 5 minutes and 1 hour
* Validation
   * Actual imports from NW and SW data used (NREL ENLITEN model)
   * Intertie flows recorded hourly
   * Baseline imports to be compared to actuals

# Additional System Modeling Considerations

* Peak hour load forecasts are not a predictor of when/how much peak load there is
* RA does not include resources not shown to CAISO
   * Solar and wind were assumed to count toward RA capacity
   * Non-RA resources shown to CAISO should be classified as "above RA" according to the resource type, (1) RA above shown amounts, (2) resource in CAISO not shown, and (3) non-RA import resources. The RA recovered is between 2500MW and 3000MW.
* Natural gas fleet under bid by 1000MW due to forced outages and performance derating
   * 400 MW of planned NG plant outages prohibited by RMO on Aug 12 were not canceled or substituted.
* Total imports increased by 3,000 MW and 2,000 MW on Aug 14 and 15, respectively, when CAISO declared the Stage 3 Emergencies.
   * SW Imports from Hoover and Palo Verde were between 2600 HW and 3400 MW higher than the RA requirements. Transmission constraints limited the resources' availability.
   * NW imports were reduced by to COI derating by 650 MW. This also caused congestion on COI and NOB interties, resulting in about 330 MW of lower RA due to line congestion.
* All types of hydro resource bid as planned, but some bid above the shown RA quantities and some operated at different quantities.
* Solar totaled above RA by 370 MW on 14 Aug and below RA by 160 MW on 15 Aug.
* Wind totaled below RA by 230 MW on 14 Aug and above RA by 120 MW on 15 Aug.
* The largest deviation of net demand peak demand was 1300 MW above RA.
* Demand response RA credits of 1,600 MW were availabile and 1,400 MW were from IOU emergency and economic DR programs mostly in RDRR. The credits included "gross-up" from avoided losses. See Table 4 for details.
* Day-ahead market practices affected dispatch
   * Under-scheduling of demand by 2161 MW and 2023 MW on Aug 14 and 15, respectively. Net-peak hour under-scheduling were 1272 MW and 1547 MW, respectively. See Table 5.
   * Convergence bidding masked tight supply and didn't work as designed in the presence of under-scheduling. [10]
   * Configuration of residual unit commitment process masked the under-scheduling and convergence bidding issues and allowed for excessive exports. This was corrected as of 5 Sep 2020.
   * Peak load forecast was low by as much as 4600MW on 17 Aug. See Table 6.

# Notes

1. I don't see mention of natural gas plant operations here. We know there was under-supply due to safety maintenance downtime right?
2. I noticed that too. I haven't seen in the CAISO report. But it might be in one of the others I haven't got to yet.
3. same questions above. are we operating under the assumption that some plants were down for unscheduled maintenance?
4. Yes, but I don't have the list of the ones that failed to come back online after they were ordered to not go down for maintenance. I'm looking for that data still.
5. This is part of the more general energy storage control problem.
6. I don't understand why this is a factor.
7. It might come from DR fatigue and free-loaders.
8. Yellow highlight indicate pending/TODO
9. @bennetm@stanford.edu, this should include the plants out for maintenance.
10. This isn't relevant to our model.
