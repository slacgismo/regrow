# PV generator data

Site 2107 is from the SETO [Solar Data Bounty Prize](https://www.herox.com/solardatabounty/update/6264). These files have been mirrored from the [OEDI S3 bucket](https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=oedi-data-lake&prefix=pvdaq%2F2023-solar-data-prize%2F), and more sites are available there. The inverter power data is too large for GitHub and should be downloaded directly from the S3 bucket.
